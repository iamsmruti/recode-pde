## recode-pde

This CLI will erase the nightmares of using the Processing IDE to run your sketches everytime after making changes. This will track the changes in the sketch and reload it for you.

Thank Me Later! ðŸ˜›


## Installation

Install with npm

```bash
  sudo npm i recode-pde -g
```
    
## Usage

You just need to open a terminal in sketch folder and then type the command
```bash
  reload
```

Things you should keep in mind 

- You must download the processing-java tool
- The sketch structure should be sketch/sketch.pde


You can get the processing-java tool from the Processing IDE

- First you need to download the Processing IDE. [link](https://processing.org/download)
- Open the IDE 
- Then you can go to tools > install "processing-java"
